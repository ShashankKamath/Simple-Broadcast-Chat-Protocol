# Simple-Broadcast-Chat-Protocol
The Simple Broadcast Chat Protocol (SBCP) is a protocol that allows clients to join and leave a global chat session, view members of the session, and send and receive messages.An instance of the server provides a single “chat room,” which can only handle a finite number of clients. Clients must explicitly JOIN the session. A client receives a list of the connected members of the chat session once they complete the JOIN transaction. Clients use SEND messages to carry chat text, and clients receive chat text from the server using the FWD message. Clients may exit unceremoniously at any time during the chat session. The server should detect a client exit, cleanup the resources allocated to that client and notify the other clients. Additionally, the client program will be able to detect idle clients and notify the server.
